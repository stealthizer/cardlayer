- **Responsive Design**: Works on different screen sizes with proportional scaling
- **No Build Process**: Just open the HTML file in any modern browser

## Interface Layout

The application consists of two main sections (simplified design):

1. **Tool Layout (30% left)**: Contains controls, image count, file importer, global card type selector, and PDF generation button
2. **A4 Layout (70% right)**: Interactive A4 paper preview where you position and rotate images with individual card type controls

## Card Specifications

### Standard Cards
- **Standard Card Size**: 63.5mm √ó 88mm (vertical orientation)
- **Rotated Card Size**: 88mm √ó 63.5mm (horizontal orientation)
- **Auto-Detection**: Automatically detects card orientation based on image aspect ratio
- **Proportional Scaling**: Cards are scaled to fit the A4 layout while maintaining proper proportions

### X-Wing Ships
- **Small Ship (X-Wing)**: 32mm √ó 38mm
- **Medium Ship (X-Wing)**: 54mm √ó 61mm
- **Large Ship (X-Wing)**: 73mm √ó 80mm
- **Rectangular Format**: Ships maintain their rectangular proportions

### X-Wing Dials
- **Inner Dial (X-Wing)**: 43mm diameter (round)
- **Front Dial (X-Wing)**: 50mm diameter (round)
- **Circular Format**: Dials maintain their round proportions
- **No Rotation**: Dials cannot be rotated (fixed orientation)
- **Aspect Ratio Preservation**: Front dial maintains natural aspect ratio in PDF output

## How to Run

### Option 1: Direct File Opening
Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser:
- Double-click the file
- Or right-click ‚Üí "Open with" ‚Üí your preferred browser

### Option 2: Local Server (Optional)
If you prefer to serve it locally:
```bash

npx serve .

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Usage

1. **Select Card Type**: Choose the card type from the global dropdown in the tool layout for new imports
2. **Import Images**: Click "üÉè Import Cards" or drag & drop image files directly onto the A4 layout
3. **Position Images**: Click and drag to reposition images on the A4 layout (grid snapping enabled)
4. **Rotate Images**: Click the rotation indicator (‚Üª) or double-click an image to rotate 90¬∞ (excludes dials)
5. **Change Card Type**: Hover over any image and use the individual dropdown to change its card type
6. **Remove Images**: Click the √ó button on any image to remove it
7. **Generate PDF**: Click "üìÑ Generate PDF" when you're ready to export

## Advanced Features

### Image Rotation
- **Visual Rotation**: Images rotate 90¬∞ with proper visual feedback
- **Dimension Handling**: Container dimensions adapt to rotated orientation
- **Control Positioning**: Rotation, card type, and remove controls stay in fixed positions
- **Collision Detection**: Uses correct dimensions for rotated images to prevent overlapping
- **PDF Generation**: Exports rotated images with correct dimensions and proper rotation
- **Dial Exclusion**: X-Wing dials (inner and front) cannot be rotated

### Grid Snapping System
- **Invisible Grid**: 10px grid system for perfect alignment
- **Automatic Snapping**: Images automatically snap to grid positions
- **Easy Alignment**: Cards align at the same level automatically
- **Consistent Positioning**: All cards follow the same grid system

### Smart Collision Detection
- **No Overlapping**: Prevents images from finishing movement on top of each other
- **Rotated Support**: Collision boundaries match rotated image orientation
- **Visual Accuracy**: Collision box matches the visible image area exactly
- **Boundary Checking**: Prevents images from going outside A4 bounds

### Alpha Channel Processing
- **PNG Support**: Automatically processes PNG images with alpha channels
- **Border Trimming**: Removes transparent borders around card images
- **Transparency Preservation**: Maintains transparency in rotated images
- **Pre-processing**: Trims borders before resizing to standard card dimensions

### Card Type Management
- **Multiple Types**: Support for Standard Cards, X-Wing ships, and X-Wing dials
- **Global Selection**: Choose card type for new imports via tool layout dropdown
- **Individual Control**: Change card type of any image after import via per-image dropdown
- **Visual Feedback**: Controls appear on hover for clean interface
- **Real-time Updates**: Images resize and reposition automatically when type changes
- **Type-Specific Behavior**: Dials use `object-fit: contain`, cards use `object-fit: cover`
